My prompts (sometimes grouped) and their impact:
1. how to install commit-msg hook in bash script? 
can i install it without separate commit-msg file? i mean kind of write it in my bash script
Impact: understood how to put hook file to the same file.

2. i have some commit msg template txt file, where is some "headers" are defined, how to check if there is this header in the commit?
how to check if commit message starts with some chars?
i need to grep it from the template file.
how can i check that the section is not empty?
will it work for multiple lines? i need to check is there some content after specific header.
grep falls in this case:
'pname-123: chagne

section1:
some changes

section2:
blablabla'
Impact: writing hook-msg part.
